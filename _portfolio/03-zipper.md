## Description
Zipper is an application designed to help project-based learning (PBL) instructors assess students' skills and process growth. Zipper is the culmination of a semester-long design process, done as an academic project in Marti Louw's Learning Media Design course as part of my METALS curriculum. The project's initial prompt was to investigate portfolio practices and assessment in PBL courses at Winchester Thurston Independent School.

<!--

Initial debrief with Mr. Marx  
Expert portfolio practicioners  
First interview  
Interview with Mr. Nye  
Observation of Mr. Marx's Research Science course  
Follow up intervieiw with Mr Marx  

## Phase 2: Synthesis
Portfolio practioners into identity model via affinity diagramming
Problem mapping of Mr Nye's & Marx's interviews 

## Phase 3: Ideation
### Speed-dating
Developed 20 ideas, narrowed down to 10 ideas
Speed-dated with Mr. Marx to determine needs
Selected "sliders" as final idea

### Service Mapping
Created service mapping to plan out product

## Phase 4: Prototyping
### Lo-Fi
Chose to create Role / Look & Feel prototype
Created lo-fi

### Hi-Fi & Validation Testing


## Conclusion
