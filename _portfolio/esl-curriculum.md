**Role** : Instructional Designer

**In Collaboration With** : Journey's End Refugee Services

**Duration** : 3 months

**Course** : Educational Goals, Instruction & Assessment, Profs. Sharon Carver & Lauren Herckis, Fall 2018

# Context
Journey's End Refugee Services helps refugees find employment and gain the skills necessary for survival in the States. Refugees often leave successful careers in their home countries to seek shelter in America, but are unable to continue that career due to limited English abilities, among other barriers. The English language skill gap is where Journey's End comes in. 

For this design, I worked with Ms. Anna Porter, a teacher at Journey's End whose classroom is designed to bridge the gap between refugee's high job desire and low English ability.
