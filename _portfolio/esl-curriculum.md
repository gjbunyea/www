## Description
By focusing on Formal vs. Informal English in specific career contexts, this 1-week module is designed to empower refugees with greater English skills and career outlook. The module was developed over a 3 month period in Fall 2018 following an iterative backward design process.  

In January 2019, the module was used by a stakeholder who praised its hands-on approach, authenticity, and cultural sensitivity.

<!-- # Development 
## Context
American students are in a tough spot as the upcoming workforce is noted for having a lack of career readiness skills (poor communication skills, poor work ethic, etcâ€¦). Refugees to America have it even tougher. Not only may they lack career readiness skills, but they lack the English language skills necessary for the workforce. The ability to communicate effectively is necessary for acquiring and retaining jobs in America. Having a job is a vital part of survival in this country, both economically and socially. Career readiness offers community and participation in society, which could benefit refugees and help them feel more welcome.

The English language skill gap is where Journey's End Refugee Services comes in. 

Journey's End Refugee Services, located in Buffalo NY, helps refugees find employment and gain the skills necessary for survival in the States. For this design, I worked with Ms. Anna Porter, a teacher at Journey's End whose classroom is designed to bridge the gap between refugee's high job desire and low English ability.

## Goals
To tap into our learners' intrinsic motivation, I chose to have all work centered around careers and job performance. The chosen careers include: Receptionist, Waiter, Store Worker, Farmer, and Cook. These are all attainable careers for our population.

Working with Ms. Porter and using the American Institute for Research's [English Language Proficiency Standards for Adult Education](https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/pdf/elp-standards-adult-ed.pdf), I developed the following set of Cognitive and Meta-Cognitive goals.
