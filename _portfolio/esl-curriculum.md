By focusing on Formal vs. Informal English in specific career contexts, this 1-week module is designed to empower refugees with greater English skills and career outlook. The module was developed over a 3 month period in Fall 2018 following an iterative backward design process.  

In January 2019, the module was used by a stakeholder who praised its hands-on approach, authenticity, and cultural sensitivity.
