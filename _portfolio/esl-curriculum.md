# Context
 Refugees to America often leave successful careers in their home countries, sacrificing their life for greater safety in the US. Even though many are highly skilled, having been doctors or researchers, most are unable to continue their career due to limited English abilities, among other barriers. The English language skill gap is where Journey's End comes in. 

<!-- American students are in a tough spot, and the current entering workforce is noted for having a lack of career readiness skills (poor communication skills, poor work ethic, etcâ€¦). Refugees to America have it even tougher. Not only may they lack career readiness skills, but they lack the English language skills necessary for the workforce. The ability to communicate effectively is necessary for acquiring and retaining jobs in America. Having a job is a vital part of survival in this country, both economically and socially. Career readiness offers community and participation in society, which could benefit refugees and help them feel more welcome. -->

Journey's End Refugee Services helps refugees find employment and gain the skills necessary for survival in the States. For this design, I worked with Ms. Anna Porter, a teacher at Journey's End whose classroom is designed to bridge the gap between refugee's high job desire and low English ability.

# Goals
To tap into the learners' intrinsic motivation, I chose to have all work centered around careers and job performance. The chosen careers include: Receptionist, Waiter, Store Worker, Farmer, and Cook. These are all attainable careers for our population.

Working with Ms. Porter and using the American Institute for Research's [English Language Proficiency Standards for Adult Education](https://lincs.ed.gov/publications/pdf/elp-standards-adult-ed.pdf), I developed the following set of Cognitive and Meta-Cognitive goals.
