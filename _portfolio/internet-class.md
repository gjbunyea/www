For 2 years, I designed, developed, taught and iterated on a large-scale seminar about *How the Internet Works* or **`internet-class`** for short. This was a new course when I was hired, meaning all content was produced from the ground up. My role involved:
* Developing in-class activities with other Teaching Assistants (TAs) and Faculty
* Producing video content for our flipped-classroom style
* Running class sections and trouble-shooting all aspects of the course
* Organizing our 30 other TAs on a weekly basis  

**`internet-class`** debuted to 440 freshmen students in Fall 2016, and increased to 660 by Fall 2017. 

Much of the work I did beginning in 2016 remain intact and part of the current course. This includes activities I developed, course structure, and overall course identity I helped to shape. 

**Role** : Head Teaching Assistant

**Company** : University at Buffalo, SUNY

**Duration** : 2 years

**Supervisors** : Prof. Geoff Challen (2016-2017), Prof. Steve Ko (2017-2018)
