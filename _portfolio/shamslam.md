ShamSlam is a card game to teach coping strategies for Impostor Syndrome. We were inspired to create a game about Impostor Syndrome based on our own personal experiences.  
  
This project is still in development, as we prepare for submission to the Games for Change Awards 2020.

# How We Made ShamSlam
## Tandem Design
Our main development framework was the Tandem-Transformational Game Design framework. Tandem Design proposes two iterative loops--educational goals and game development--with alignment between them.

In the Goal Loop, you do lit review, research, and synthesize findings to define what it is you'll teach.

In the Game Loop you develop the game, playtest, and evaluate enjoyment. 

Between the loops, you Align to ensure that your goals and game line up.

## Goal Loop
* Lit Review
* Interviews
* Synthesis

## Game Loop
* Parallel Prototyping
* Play-testing
* Revisions

## Alignment
* Goal Changes
* Aesthetic Changes
