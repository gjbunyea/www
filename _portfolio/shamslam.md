## Description
ShamSlam is a table-top mental-health game that aims to teach players best coping strategies for Impostor Syndrome. It was initially developed for Design for Educational Games, a course taught by Erik Harpstead at CMU. We were inspired to create a game about Impostor Syndrome based on our own personal experiences.  
  
This project is still in development, as we prepare for submission to educational game competitions.
