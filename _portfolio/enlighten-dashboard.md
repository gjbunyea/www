## The Enlighten Dashboard
The Enlighten Dashboard aims to provide context and
connectivity to school improvement. Gone are the days
of national standards and working in silos. With the
Enlighten Dashboard, school or district administrators
can:  

• Easily find schools that have a similar demographic
makeup to their own  
• Plot those schools’ performance data providing a
sense of context to achievement  
• Analyze intervention differences to see what their
own school could try next  
• And connect to administrators, fostering
professional communities of like-context schools
