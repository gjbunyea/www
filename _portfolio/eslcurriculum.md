## Description
I developed a 1-week curriculum for Ms. Anna Porter, who teaches ESL courses to adult refugees. After an interview with Ms. Porter, we selected to develop a conversation-focused module that emphasizes career preparationâ€”a particular interest of her students. This module was developed for Educational Goals, Instruction and Assessment, a METALS Core Course taught by Sharon Carver and Lauren Herckis. 

Ms. Porter piloted this module in February 2019 praising the activities designed and understanding of her course culture.
