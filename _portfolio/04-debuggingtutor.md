## Description
Debugging Tutor is an intelligent tutor that breaks down debugging into several steps. As computer scientists, all three of us felt that debugging is poorly taught, often focusing on how to debug a specific item (loop for example). The tutor is the result of research to better understand how debugging is a process, like medical diagnosis or scientific inquiry. This work was done for Vincent Aleven's Advanced Topics in Personalized Online Learning course, Spring 2019.
