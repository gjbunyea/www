## Description
As our METALS Capstone project, my team and I work with Renaissance Learning, Inc. to research and develop a dashboard enabling school districts to compare their student's achievement to similar schools. We have spent Spring 2019 researching and ideating with district administrators across the country. 

This project is ongoing. We are currently completing design research as we begin developing and iterating on our product.
