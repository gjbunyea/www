## Description
PulmonaryPal is a notebook designed for COPD patients in Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR). We envision PulmonaryPal as an integral part of PR, acting as a daily health tracker as well as scaffolding key learnings. This project was completed as part of Stacie Rohrbach's Learner Experience Design course at Carnegie Mellon's School of Design.
