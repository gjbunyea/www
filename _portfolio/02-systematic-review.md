Systematic Reivew and Meta-Analysis is a semester-long course on advanced research practices. Developed by the Campbell Collaboration Training Group since 2020, this course development project was a perfect union, as the Open Learning Initiative's evidence-based courseware was a match made for the groups' content. 

Systematic Review is currently reaching maturity as it makes its public debut this Spring.
