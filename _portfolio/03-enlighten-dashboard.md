My Master's Capstone project, sponsored by Renaissance Learning, Inc, involved investigating K-12 school administrators' need for school-to-school demographic comparison. The result of a 7-month research, design, development and testing cycle, the Enlighten Dashboard allows administrators to compare, analyze, and connect to schools most similar to their own.
