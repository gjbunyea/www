Wellstart is a series of Mental Health modules developed by the Amerian College Health Association (ACHA). The course blends MOOC-style authored content, with the Open Learning Initiative's (OLI) evidence-based methodology to create a "best of both worlds" course.

After a successful pilot to 1100 students nation-wide, we are currently evaluating the learning data to find areas of improvement.
