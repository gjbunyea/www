## Current
I'm currently working toward my Masters in Education Technology and Applied Learning Science [(**METALS**)](https://metals.hcii.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu). Here, I study Learning Science, Computer Science, Design and User-Centered Research Methodologies. 

## Past
Prior to METALS, I recieved a B.A. in Computer Science from [the University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://buffalo.edu). While at Buffalo, I spent two years designing, developing, and iterating on a lage-scale seminar called CSE 199: How the Internet Works.  

## Personal
I come from a large Italian-American family, living in the Greater NYC area. I like drawing cartoons, having big meals with friends, and making homemade pizzas.
