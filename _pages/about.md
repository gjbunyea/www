## Future
I'm currently seeking a role where I can investigate, design and create solutions to learning problems. I'm passionate about art, computer science, work-force development, and Social-Emotional education, but open to all great education challenges. Please contact me if you have an opportunity available!

## Present
I have recently graduated from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://cmu.edu)'s Masters in Education Technology and Applied Learning Science [(**METALS**)](https://metals.hcii.cmu.edu). Through METALS, I have learned how to use academic and user-centered research, learning science principles, and novel technologies to create curricula, intelligent tutors, and ed-tech products.

## History
I received a B.A. in Computer Science from [the University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://buffalo.edu) in 2018. While at Buffalo, I spent two years designing, developing, and iterating on a large-scale seminar called _How the Internet Works_, lovingly referred to as [internet-class](https://internet-class.org). My work on internet-class is what inspired me to pursue education as a field, ultimately leading me to METALS.

## Personal
I come from a large Italian-American family, living in the Greater NYC area. I like drawing cartoons, having big meals with friends, and making homemade pizzas.
